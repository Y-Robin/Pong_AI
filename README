# PongAI Game

PongAI is a modern take on the classic game of Pong, enhanced with the power of Artificial Intelligence. This project enables users to train a neural network to play Pong, compete against the AI, or enjoy a classic two-player game.

## Features

- **AI Training**: Train an AI model to learn playing Pong by observing and adapting to gameplay.
- **Single Player vs. AI**: Test your skills against a trained AI model.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Enjoy the classic Pong game with friends.

## Requirements

The game and AI are built using several powerful libraries. Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV-Python

## Installation

Before running the game, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy tensorflow matplotlib opencv-python
```


## Structure

- "main.py": The script used to train the AI model.
- "main1vsKI.py": A script that allows you to play against the trained AI.
- "main_2Players.py": A script for a classic two-player game without AI.

## Usage

### Training the AI

To train the model, run:

```bash
python main.py
```


This will initiate the training process. The model will learn by playing against itself. Progress can be monitored via the console output.

### Playing Against the AI

Once the model is trained, you can test your skills against it:

```bash
python main1vsKI.py
```


Use the up and down arrow keys to control your paddle.

### Two-Player Mode

To play a game of Pong with a friend:

```bash
python main_2Players.py
```


Player 1 uses the W and S keys, while Player 2 uses the up and down arrow keys.

## Custom Game Environment

The game leverages a custom Pong environment ("pong_game.py") tailored for AI interaction and classic gameplay.

## AI Model

The AI ("model.py") is built using TensorFlow and employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn the game.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the game or the AI, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
